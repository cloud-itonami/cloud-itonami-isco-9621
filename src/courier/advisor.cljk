(ns courier.advisor
  "Messenger, Package Deliverer and Luggage Porter Advisor — proposing a
  delivery-route scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a
  delivery-log/progress record, schedule a crew operation, flag a
  safety concern, coordinate a delivery-equipment/consumables
  procurement order) from a crew roster, route registration and
  safety-reporting policy. Swappable mock/llm; the advisor ONLY
  proposes — `courier.governor` independently gates every proposal and
  always escalates safety concerns and above-threshold supply orders.
  The advisor never proposes to directly finalize a delivery-execution
  decision (e.g. authorizing a specific delivery route or luggage-
  handling operation) or a route-safety-clearance decision (e.g.
  declaring a route cleared for safety), and never proposes to override
  a route safety supervisor's judgment — those stay permanently out of
  this actor's scope. Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-9611's
  wastecollect.advisor for the outdoor-route hazard-domain shape,
  extended with a second, independent delivery-traffic/manual-lifting
  hazard-scope dimension.
