# Security Policy

This project handles messenger/package-delivery/luggage-portering
delivery-route operating workflows. Treat vulnerabilities as potentially
high impact even when the demo data is synthetic — this domain's failure
modes include physical worker-safety risk (delivery-traffic hazard:
bicycle/vehicle/pedestrian delivery-route injury) and manual-lifting
risk (back injury from carrying packages/luggage, equipment condition).

## Do Not Disclose Publicly

Report privately before opening public issues for:

- credential exposure
- real worker, route or operator data exposure
- authorization bypass
- CourierRouteGovernor bypass
- audit-ledger tampering
- over-disclosure in reports or exports
- unsafe robot action dispatch
- any path that lets a proposal reach a delivery-execution decision,
  a route-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring a route cleared
  for safety), or a route-safety-supervisor override decision

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available for the repository.
If that is unavailable, contact the repository maintainers through the
cloud-itonami organization before publishing details.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected and actual behavior
- impact on worker/route data, policy enforcement or audit logging
- suggested fix, if known

## Production Guidance

- Store secrets outside Git.
- Keep real worker/route/operator data outside this repository.
- Run policy tests before deployment.
- Export and review audit logs regularly.
- Use least privilege for operators and service accounts.
